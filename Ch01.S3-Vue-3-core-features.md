# Chapter1 Creating Your First Application in Vue 3

(extracted from `Ch01.md` )

## Section 3: Vue 3 core features â€“ components and built-in directives

### S1.3.1  Components

`Vue 3`: a **component-based** framework

component structure:

- template
- option object
- styles

How to create a component? Use `app.component(nameString, optionObj)` method

To the simplest form, the optionObj must contain `props` and `template` attributes

- A **prop** is a special attribute that lets a Vue component pass some data to a child component
- A child component has the `props` property to define what kind of value it will accept

```js
const App = {
    data: () => ({
        todos: [
            {description: 'eat'},
            {description: 'drink'},
            {description: 'sleep'},
        ]
    })
};
const app = Vue.createApp(App);
app.component('todo-item', {
    props: ['todo'],
    template: `<li>{{todo.description}}</li>`
});
app.mount('#app');
```

corresponding HTML: (see `Chapter01/todos/index.diy.html` for more detail)

```html
<div id="app">
    <div>
        <ol>
            <todo-item v-for="todo in todos" :todo="todo"></todo-item>
        </ol>
    </div>
</div>
```

> Note:

1. the colon `:` is short for directive `v-bind`, a built-in Vue directive to pass data to a child component as a `prop`;

2. `Vue` 3 would automatically convert the `prop` value from `camelCase` to `kebab-case`;

3. `v-for` directive: a `key` prop should be added to keep track of the items properly, which should be a unique ID. see `Chapter01/v-for/index.diy.html` for more details.

   ```html
   <todo-item v-for="todo in todos" :todo="todo" :key="todo.id"></todo-item>
   <script>
       const App = {
           data: () => ({
               todos: [
                   { id: 1, description: 'eat' },
                   { id: 2, description: 'drink' },
                   { id: 3, description: 'sleep' },
               ]
           })
       };
       const app = Vue.createApp(App);
       app.component('todo-item', {
           props: ['todo'],
           template: `<li>{{todo.description}}</li>`
       });
       app.mount('#app');
   </script>
   ```

4. `Vue` components look like `custom elements` to some extent. But they cannot be used interchangeably.

---



#### 1. Component life cycle

in chonological order:

- `beforeCreate`: after the app is mounted with `app.mount()`, where events and life cycle are initialized. Then components are initialized with **reactive properties**
- `created`: reactive properties are initialized here and can be accessed in this method. Then the component's template (or render functions) are run.
- `beforeMount`: Once the content is loaded, this method is run. Once the beforeMounted is run, the app will be mounted into the element (`div#app`)
- `mounted`: this mounted hook is run once the app  is mounted to the element.
  - `beforeUpdate`: whenever any reactive property changes, this hook is run. Then the virtual DOM is rendered. It's a good place to run any initialization code for third-party libraries here.
  - `updated`
- `beforeDestroy`: right before the component is unmounted. Also a good place to run any cleanup code here before destroying the component.
- `destroyed`: this hook is run when the component is destroyed. Reactive properies won't be available here.



#### 2. Reactive properties

`count++` version example file path: `Chapter01/reactive-properties/index.diy1.html`

```html
<div id="app">
    <button @click="count++">increment</button>
    count: {{count}}
</div>
<script>
    const App = {
        data: () => ({count: 0})
    };
    Vue.createApp(App).mount('#app');
</script>
```

the `@click="count++"` expression listens for clicks of the button, `@click` is short for `v-on:click` directive.

`increment` method example file path: `Chapter01/reactive-properties/index.diy2.html`

```html
<div id="app">
    <button @click="increment">increment</button>
    count: {{count}}
</div>
<script>
    const App = {
        data: () => ({ count: 0 }),
        methods: {
            increment(e){
                this.count++;
            }
        }
    };
    Vue.createApp(App).mount('#app');
</script>
```

Notice that `this.count` in the Vue instance object is the same as `count` in the template. The `this` keyword refers to the component instance.

the `methods` property is used to hold methods in our code that we can reference in other parts of the Vue instance or in our template, by `this.<methodName>`. The `this` represents the Vue instance, too. (could be omitted in the template)



#### 3. Handling user input

DIY example file path: `Chapter01/user-input/index.diy.html`:

```html
<div id="app">
    <p>{{message}}</p>
    <input type="text" v-model="message"/>
</div>
<script>
    const App = {
        data: () => ({ message: 'hello world.' })
    };
    Vue.createApp(App).mount('#app');
</script>
```

Note: the value of `v-model` directive should be the reactive property name `message`, instead of adding redundant curly braces (trial at first time: `v-model="{{message}}"`, which failed)

`v-model` directive will do the synchronization between the inputted value and the reactive property `message`



#### 4. Conditionals and loops

- `v-if`: toggle existance
- `v-show`: toggle visibility

DIY example file path: `Chapter01/v-if/index.diy.html`

```html
<div id="app">
    <span v-if="show">hello world</span>
</div>
<script>
    const App = {
        data: () => ({ 
            show: true  // false to have no span tag 
        })
    };
    Vue.createApp(App).mount('#app');
</script>
```



Another example to illustrate the use of `v-for` directive without creating component: (`Chapter01/v-for/index.withoutcomponent.diy.html`)

```html
<div id="app">
    <div>
        <ol>
            <li v-for="todo in todos" :key="todo.id">
                {{todo.description}}
            </li>
        </ol>
    </div>
</div>
<script>
    const App = {
        data: () => ({
            todos: [
                {id: 1, description: 'eat'},
                {id: 2, description: 'drink'},
                {id: 3, description: 'sleep'}
            ],
        })
    };
    Vue.createApp(App).mount('#app');
</script>
```

Here the `v-for` directive accepts a value that is a special JavaScript expression that lets us loop through the array `todos`. The `todo` variable is the individual *todos* entry that is being iterated.

Also an errata is found here in line 4 in the book, where `:keu` should be `:key`.



#### 5. Template syntax

DIY example file path: `Chapter01/v-html/index.diy.html`:

```html
<div id="app">
    <span v-html="rawHtml"></span>
</div>
<script>
    const App = {
        data: () => ({ rawHtml: '<b>hello world</b>' })
    };
    Vue.createApp(App).mount('#app');
</script>
```

The `v-html` directive lets us display HTML code as real HTML rather than as plain text.

#### 6. JavaScript expressions and templates

The content in between the curly braces `{{}}` could only be the JavaScript expressions, instead of any JavaScript statements:

```vue
{{ number + 1 }} 
{{ areYouSure ? 'YES' : 'NO' }}
{{ message.split('').reverse().join('') }}
```

instead, below are all the invalid JS statements, which should be prohibited:

```vue
{{ var foo = 1 }}
{{ if (yes) { return message } }}
```



#### 7. Computed properties

**Computed properties** are special reactive properties that are derived from **other reactive properties**.

they must be **synchronous** functions

DIY example file path: `Chapter01/computed-properties/index.diy.html`:

```html
<div id="app">
    <p>{{message}}</p>
    <p>{{reversedMessage}}</p>
</div>
<script>
    const App = {
        data: () => ({ message: 'hello world' }),
        computed: {
            reversedMessage() {
                return this.message.split('').reverse().join('')
            }
        }
    };
    Vue.createApp(App).mount('#app');
</script>
```

Notice that here the ***arrow function*** version of `reversedMessage` would failed due to the value of `this.message` is ***undefined***:

![invalid arrow function version](assets/c1-6.png)



### S1.3.2 Directives

Directives are special attributes that start with the `v-` prefix. 

They expect single **JavaScript expressions** as values.

They can also take arguments in addition to values like this: `<a v-on:click="doSomething"> ... </a>`:

- The `v-on` part: is the **directive's name**. 
- The `click` part: is the **argument** for the directive, i.e. the part between the colon (`:`) and the equal (`=`) sign.
-  `doSomething` is the **value** of the directive

Directive arguments can be dynamic:

```vue
<a v-bind:[attributeName]="url"> ... </a>
```

We listen to the event with the given `eventName`. `eventName` should also be a string.



#### Directive modifiers

Directives modifiers are designed to change the behavior of a directive. 

They're special postfixes that are denoted by a dot (`.`)

to prevent the default submission behavior, use `prevent` modifier onto the `submit` event like this:

```vue
<form v-on:submit.prevent="onSubmit">...</form>
```
