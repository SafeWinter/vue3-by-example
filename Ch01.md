Vue 3 is is a **component-based** framework.

Contents in Chapter 1:

- Understanding Vue as a framework
- Setting up the Vue project
- Vue 3 core features – components and built-in directives
- Debugging with Vue.js Devtools

## Section 1 Understanding Vue as a framework

Similar concepts in other frameworks:

- **Directives**: manipulate DOM like in `Angular`
- **Templates**: render data like `Angular`
- **props**: pass data between components, like `Angular` & `React`
- **plugin**: for feature extension, like `Angular`



 Concepts exclusive to `Vue`:

- **computed properties**: component properties that are derived from other properties
- **watcher**:  to watch for reactive data changes
- **reactive data**: `Vue` watch data and actions are done automatically when reactive data changes
- **`script` tag support**: new feature in `Vue` 3, great for legacy frontend
- **no build tools to add**: unlike other framework
- **Vue Router** library: for routing, compatible with `Vue` 3
- **Vuex** library: for state management, compatible with `Vue` 3



## Section 2 Setting up the Vue project with the Vue CLI and script tag

### S1.2.1 import via `script` tag 

with **latest** version: (latest version is `v3.2.24` when taking notes)

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@next"></script>
```

For **production** mode, replace the `next` word with a **fixed version number**:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@3.2.24"></script>
```



### S1.2.2 install as a package

```bash
$ npm install vue@next
```



### S1.2.3 via Vue CLI

with `Vue` 3, use `Vue CLI v4.5`:

```bash
$ yarn global add @vue/cli@next
# or
$ npm install -g @vue/cli@next
```

to upgrade our Vue project to Vue 3:

```bash
$ vue upgrade –-next
```



### S1.2.4 use `Vite` build tool

With the `Vite` build tool, the new project can work with modules **natively**, which makes it serve our project faster than conventional `Vue CLI`.

set up a Vue project from scratch by running these commands:

the `NPM` version:

```bash
$ npm init vite-app <project-name>
$ cd <project-name>
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

the `yarn` version:

```bash
$ yarn create vite-app <project-name>
$ cd <project-name>
$ yarn
$ yarn dev
```



### S1.2.5 use various builds of Vue

the **CDN versions** don't come with bundles.Recognize them by the `vue(.runtime).global(.prod).js` pattern in the filename, and include them directly with a `script` tag.

- `vue.global.js`: the full build containing both the `compiler` and the `runtime`
- `vue.runtime.global.js`: only contains the `runtime`.

The file ends with `.prod.js` are **production ready** as they're **minified**. These aren't **Universal Module Definition** (**UMD**) builds, which contain **IIFEs** that are meant to be used with regular script tags.

When a bundler is used, like `Webpack`, `Rollup`, or `Parcel`, then use `vue(.runtime).esm-bundler.js` file, which alse has a `full version` as well as `runtime version`. 

Use `process.env.NODE_ENV` is to toggle **development** or **production** branch.



### S1.2.6 Creating your Vue instance

code to the `index.html`: (the revised version, in `Chapter01/simple-counter/index.html`)

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <title>Vue App</title>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@next"></script>
</head>
<body>
    <div id="app">
        count: {{count}}
    </div>
    <script>
        const Counter = {
            data: () => ({
                count: 0
            })
        };
        Vue.createApp(Counter).mount('#app');
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

Demo effect (using live server extension with `VSCode`):

>  **Notes**

-  `script` tag in `head`: import latest version (`v3.2.24`)
-  `div` with the ID **app**: a template container
- `script` tag in `body`: use to create `Vue` app
  - `Counter` object: use to create our app
  - `data` property: returns the **initial values of our states**. The states are reactive automatically.
  - `count`:  a reactive **state** ready to be updated. Same as the one in template
- `Vue.createApp(obj)`: use `Counter` object to:
  - compile the template
  - connect the reactive properties (`count`)
  - render the expression in `{{}}` as final result
- `mount(selector)`: accepts a `CSS` **selector** as its argument, representing the template to render the app in:
  - **Expressions** in curly braces will be rendered
  - **Attributes** will be interpreted by `Vue` as `props` or `directives`



> **ANYTHING in the curly braces `{{}}` must be:**
>
> - **some expression that contains *reactive properties***
> - **other JavaScript *expressions***





## Section 3: Vue 3 core features

(see **Ch01.S3-Vue 3 core features.md** for detail)



## Section 4: Debugging with Vue.js Devtools

With `Vue.js Devtools`, we can have more visibility in our app. `Vue.js Devtools` is a Chrome or Firefox extension that we can use to debug our Vue.js applications.

### S1.4.1 Installation

- **Chrome** version: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vuejs-devtools/nhdogjmejiglipccpnnnanhbledajbpd
- **Firefox** version: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/vue-js-devtools/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=search
- **Manual** installation: https://github.com/vuejs/devtools
  - DIY installation instructions: [Chome 最新版 vue-devtools 六步快速安装教程](https://blog.csdn.net/frgod/article/details/115602294)

Once completed, press <kbd>F12</kbd> to activate the plugin in Chrome. You should see the `Vue` tab in the browser's development console.



### S1.4.2 Case1: Show component tree

If our component has a `name` property, then it will be displayed in the component tree of the application. Add a html file `index.html` in a new folder `Chapter01/component-tree/`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <title>Vue App</title>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@next"></script>
</head>

<body>
    <div id="app">
        <foo></foo>
    </div>
    <script>
        const App = {
            data() {
                return {};
            }
        };
        const app = Vue.createApp(App);
        app.component("foo", {
            data() {
                return {
                    message: "I am foo."
                };
            },
            name: "foo1",
            template: `<p>{{message}}</p>`
        });
        app.mount("#app");
    </script>
</body>

</html>
```

Open with live server, you'll see the component tree in `Vue` tag like this:

![vue component tree](assets/c1-2.png)

Notice that the name for component `foo` is `foo1`.



### S1.4.3 Case2: the *Timeline* menu item

There is also the **Timeline** menu item to inspect the events that are emitted. Use the demo file in `Chapter01/reactive-properties/` folder. Again, open with live server, and toggle to the **Timeline** item in the `Vue` tag. Click the <kbd>increment</kbd> button and check the timeline like this:

![timeline menu item in vue devtool plugin](assets/c1-3.png)

Clicking on the **increment** button, the mouse events will be logged in the **Timelines** section. The time the event is triggered will also be logged.

Also, the way to display the component names could be configured in **Global settings** item. You must select the <kbd>Inspector</kbd> button first, and then click the hidden menu on the upper right corner to show the **Component names**. There're three options to be configured: `Original`, `PascalCase`, and `kebab-case` as follows:
